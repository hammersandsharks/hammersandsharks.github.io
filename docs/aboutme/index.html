      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>I'm Brian Burton, I live in the UK and I have a family (details of whom probably won't appear on this site).</p>
<p>I'm an engineer by training and by trade, with a background spanning telecommunications networks, IT architecture and IT/Network Security. I'm a big fan of discovering and optimising how things work and not necessarily what they do (although you need to know a bit about what something does to optimise how it does it).</p>
<p>I'm a generalist, so I program a bit, I solder a bit, I coach engineers, I design solutions that can handle global scale and I do my own emerging technology research.</p>
<h3>At work</h3>
<p>I help <a href="https://www.vodafone.com">Vodafone Group</a> to answer some fundamental questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What comes next?, and</li>
<li>How do we make this better?</li>
</ul>
<p>As a Distinguished Engineer, I do everything from building proof of concept demonstrations to writing company strategy and influencing the career paths and decisions of our engineers.</p>
<p>I'm a stereotypical white, male engineer and I try my best to use that privileged position to expose the talents of engineers around me who might not get the same opportunities as I do. I'm not perfect, so if I'm not doing enough, call me out on it.</p>
<h3>At home</h3>
<p>I'm a Dad and an Assistant Cub Scout leader. I cycle, I wear out hiking boots, I read (fiction only - I get enough bizarre non-fiction in daily life!), I take photographs, I play computer games occasionally (badly) and I like to geek out with tech.</p>
<p>For my tech pleasure, I love playing with physical computing and home automation, with a bit of robotics thrown in. I'm a keen PC builder and owner of many, many Raspberry Pis (including being the proud owner of one of the original batch - yes, the 256Mb one with the Hynix memory!). And don't get me started on LEDs and data storage. I love LEDs and data storage.</p>
<h2>How can I help you?</h2>
<p>Good question - that depends on what you're looking for.</p>
<p>At home, I'm usually surrounded by half completed electronics projects, computer components, cameras, fairly amateur bits of code in several languages and 3D printing experiments. I do most of my own DIY, woodwork, plumbing, electrical work (where permitted, of course) and decorating. I have a relatively short attention span for things, but because of that I also get into all sorts of topics, so if it's STEM* related I can usually talk with you about it.</p>
<p>The thing I do <em>really</em> well is pick up new things, form reasonably accurate opinions on them quickly and discover new ways of applying them.</p>
<p>If you want something prototyped, I can often help.</p>
<p>If you need a sounding board to help work through a problem I can help with that, too.</p>
<p>I'm also a big fan of coaching people to their own success: apprentices, final-year undergraduates, graduates in their first roles, through to junior and senior professional engineers.</p>
<h2>Where can you find me?</h2>
<p>I don't get about much on social media, but you can find me on <a href="https://www.github.com/brian-burton">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.twitter.com/brian_j_burton">Twitter</a> and maybe, if I'm feeling confident enough one day, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~brian-burton">NPM</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>* I only say STEM rather than STEAM because although I'm creative I'm not artistic - you do <strong>not</strong> want my art or fashion advice.</p>
<p>I don't offer opinions on or for any of my employers, past, present or future unless you contact me at work.</p>
