# So, why am I blogging?

I haven't blogged before. Not once, ever.

Why start now?

I've done quite a lot, but I'm terrible at documenting things, so I figured if I got into the habit of communicating, then I should be able to get some things across in a way that suits my style. That means get it out quick, show you a few things I've done and don't be professional about it until I'm so wildly popular that I can pay someone to be my media manager. That means you're going to get a raw stream of consciousness with barely any processing between dictation and screen. No, I'm not even going to type this.
